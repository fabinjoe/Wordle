# Wordle
A program that uses probability information theory to solve the Wordle Puzzle. This program also has the ability to solve variations of the Wordle Puzzle. 
The first variation being the Hard Mode of the Wordle Puzzle, wherein subsequent words MUST use the information recieved from previous attempts. The second is 
Multiple Simultaneous Wordle Puzzles. In this variation we have to find more than one word, but an attempted word will be used for all the hidden words. 
Duordle and Quordle are such clone puzzles which requires one to solve two and four simultaneous words respectively.

Lastly I utillized Selienium to automate the entire process. Therefore, the program has the ability to open the wordle site, and solve for the daily word without ANY
user intervention. Utilized webscapping techneques, and IO control libraries to automate the process.
